## 🛠️ Project Workflow

This repository uses a custom automation system to maintain consistency and speed up the problem-solving process.

### Creation & Setup
To bootstrap a new challenge:
```bash
make exercise "Number. Problem Title"
```

### Development & Testing
Solutions are developed in Python and verified using `pytest`. Environment management is handled by `uv`:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Automation
The repository includes a Git pre-commit hook that automatically updates the problem count in the README whenever a new solution is committed.
